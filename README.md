## üßê What is honeypot? <a name = "intro"></a>
`In computer terminology, a honeypot is a computer security mechanism set to detect, deflect, or, in some manner, counteract attempts at unauthorized use of information systems. Generally, a honeypot consists of data (for example, in a network site) that appears to be a legitimate part of the site and contain information or resources of value to attackers. It is actually isolated, monitored, and capable of blocking or analyzing the attackers. This is similar to police sting operations, colloquially known as "baiting" a suspect.`[[1]](#honeypot_term)


<b> This tutorial will intentially creating a vulnerable EC2 server, do not deploy this on your production server!! </b>

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
No coding exprience required! We will be using the Free tier AWS EC2 server to see ssh authentication attempts.

### Prerequisites
```
AWS account
Computer
Internet connection
```

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

### Creating a free tier AWS EC2 Server

Log into AWS with your AWS account then click `Services`(Drop down menu on the top left) -> click `EC2` -> click `Launch Instances`

Select `Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM), SSD Volume Type` -> click `Review Instance Launch`

Click on the first drop down menu and select `Create a new key pair` -> select `Key pair type` `RSA` -> name `Key pair` name as `honeypotkey`-> Click `Download Keypair`

Congrats! You built your EC2 server!

### Connecting to your EC2

In your instance dashboard you should see a row created. Instance state should be running in couple minutes after you completed previous step.

Right Click the row -> select `Connect` -> click `SSH client`

####Open command prompt and connect to your instance using your key

On the Mac and open terminal -> insert your path of downloaded key and connect to your EC2

Run this command:
`chmod 400 honeypotkey.cer`

example:
`ssh -i "honeypotkey.cer" ec2-user@ec2-00-000-0000-00.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com`

<b> If you're having trouble with this step or using windows, please take a look at this references</b>
- Connect to AWS EC2 instance via ssh from windows https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f52IOtTqcP8
- How do I set up SSH access for an Amazon EC2 instance? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6394762/how-do-i-set-up-ssh-access-for-an-amazon-ec2-instance

### Setting up Honeypot on your EC2

#### Enabling password authentication

Excute these commands on your EC2 Server:

`sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.bak`

`sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config`

Press `Ctrl+W`, put `PasswordAuthentication no`, `Enter`

Change `PasswordAuthentication no` to `PasswordAuthentication yes`

Press `Ctrl+X`, `Y`, `Enter`

Run `sudo systemctl restart sshd`


#### Moving AWS ssh port to 222

##### Modifying AWS Security Group

In your AWS Website EC2 Console:

Click on the running EC2 instance -> It should highlight the row

In bottom havles of the screen, click security

`Details|**Security**|Networking|Storage| Status checks| Monitoring| Tags`

Then click on your blue highlighted security group (it should be named somethingsomthing-launch-wizard)

Click `Edit in-bound rules`

Click `Add rule`

Input `222` in the Port range  and select `anywhere` then click `save rules`

eg. image


In your EC2 instance(command prompt):
Run

`sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh_sshd_config.bak2`

`sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config`

Edit  `#Port 22` to `Port 222`

Press `Ctrl+X`, `Y`, `Enter`

Run `sudo systemctl restart ssh`

<b> Now when you're login to ssh you must let computer know you're connecting through port 222</b>
example/

if you used this to connect to your EC2 instance previously:

`ssh -i "honeypotkey.cer" ec2-user@ec2-00-000-0000-00.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com`

Now you must add `-p 222` to connecct

`ssh -i "honeypotkey.cer" ec2-user@ec2-00-000-0000-00.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com -p 222`

Congrats! you moved your ssh(port 22 by default) to 222!


###Creating the Key

`sudo ssh-keygen -A`

`cd /etc/ssh`

`chmod 400 authorized_keys `

`chmod 400 ssh_host_*`


#### Install compliers

In your EC2 server: 

Run `sudo yum install gcc gcc-c++ autoconf automake zlib-devel openssl-devel make -y`

#### Download openssh

In your EC2 server: 

Run 

`mkdir ssh-source`, `cd ssh-source`

`wget -c https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/portable/openssh-8.0p1.tar.gz`

`tar -xvzf openssh-8.0p1.tar.gz`

`cd openssh-8.0p1/`

`./configure`
^This might take couple minutes to complete

`make`


`cd /home/ec2-user/ssh-source/openssh-8.0p1/`
`sudo cp auth-passwd.c auth-passwd.c.orig`

`sudo nano auth-passwd.c`

add `#include "canohost.h`

and


```
if (*password != '\0')
{
const char *remote_ip;
remote_ip = ssh_remote_ipaddr(ssh);
struct tm *timePtr;
time_t localTime;
char timeString[100];

localTime = time(NULL);
timePtr = localtime(&localTime);
strftime(timeString, 100, "%D %r", timePtr);

FILE *logFile;
logFile = fopen("/var/log/sshd_attempts","a+");
fprintf (logFile,"From: %s at: %s | user: %s, pass: %s\n", \
remote_ip, timeString, authctxt->user, password);
fclose (logFile);
}
```


Press `Ctrl+X`, `Y`, `Enter`

Run

`./configure`

`make`

`cd /usr/local/etc`

`sudo cp /etc/ssh/ssh_host_* .`

`sudo /home/ec2-user/ssh-source/openssh-8.0p1/sshd -f /usr/local/etc/sshd_config`
